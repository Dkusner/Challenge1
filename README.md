•	Python xxxx
•	MySQL 3.xxxx
•	IOS – Sierra
•	Date from hubspot  -“Engagements overview”

The libraries imported are:
•	csv
•	time
•	xxxxx

c)	The relevant fields are organized and sorted in a sequential order.
d)	The script the groups the data and outputs a CSV file which contains a readable table.
e)	Within the in python console, run command: xxxxxxxxxx. Once the command  is executed, a csv file (filename.csv)  is output in the home directory.


## 4.	Reading Data

•	A SQL Query (filename)   pulls the Engagements per Day broken and groups them by type. The count of each type per day is displayed .
•	Schema is filenamexxxxxx
