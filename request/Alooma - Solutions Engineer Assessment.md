Alooma SE Challenge!
Extracting Data

Pull Data from Hubspot.  Using their API and Python, build out logic to extract Engagement data from their endpoint.  Organize this data and store it into a file structure that makes sense.

-	Auth: https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/overview (see demo key)
-	Engagments API: https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/methods/engagements/engagements-overview

Spin Up a relational db Instance, you can choose either:
-	 Postgres 9.4+
-	 MySQL 5.6+
-	 Oracle 11g+
-	 SQL server(but please provide the docker image tag for it)


Create a table and Load the Data In (this can be done during reads as well)

Reading Data
Write a SQL Query that pulls the Engagements per Day broken down by type.  You should expose the counts per day as well.

Present these results in a format that makes sense to view

Results
Your work and the results of the analysis should be available in a github repository, and will include:
-	A documentation of your code and how to run it + supported python versions and external packages imported
-	A walkthrough of the steps taken to tackle the issues
-	Schema creation/migration files



Bonus Points:
-	present a rolling 2 week avg for each day.  

Feel free to reach out with any questions as you get started!
